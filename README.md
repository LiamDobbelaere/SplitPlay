SplitPlay is more of an unfinished (but functional, sort of) project of mine. With SplitPlay you can stream a part of your screen over LAN to another user (also running SplitPlay). The person who watches your stream can send key input through a controller back to you. This allows you to play splitscreen games over LAN, theoretically. In practice, there are a lot of problems with this one. The packets that are sent over UDP are usually too large, and the quality has to be botchered too much for the packets to fit through. Basically you have a terrible quality/performance balance. The packet size also depends way too much on what's on the screen.

It is still a functional project, and I'd like to leave it here in case anyone else is able to build on it and turn it into something useful. I did try a lot of stuff like streaming compressed video instead, but I'm no good at programming that kind of stuff. If you can make use of this to some degree, please contact me because I'd be interested what you could make of it.
